Given I sam searching for good restrooms near me
When I open the app, I am able to see the map markers with basic review information on the map
When I hover over the marker, the information with rating and icons appears in the popup
When I search for restrooms
I am given options within a certain radius 
When I log into the app
User authentication will occur and redirect to login if the inputs are not correct
When I log in with the correct user inputs
I am able to add markers with reviews and information about the bathroom
When I add a review, I can add text, give a star rating, and check boxes of popular facilities in bathrooms
As a user, I can leave multiple reviews and markers
I can see that each bathroom can have multiple reviews
```


Model
* User

* Reviews (star rating as well as comments?)
- Male, female, unisex
- Changing tables
- Menstruation products
- disabled access
- key

* Map Markers (location info, lat, Lon)

User has many reviews
Reviews belongs to User

User belongs to Many markers
Through reviews
Markers belongs to many  users
Through reviews 

Reviews belongs to Markers
Reviews belongs to User

Controller

View

- Conditionally render icons on review property 
- scroll on modal for comments, average rating at top

Confusions: But honestly we can work on this last

- Searching within a specified radius
- Map should know what current location is (button to bring user camera back to current location)

Nice to have:

- Send coordinates to apple or google maps (get directions button)
- Clustering
- More amenities
